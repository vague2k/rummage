## Installation

```
go install github.com/vague2k/rummage
```

## Alias

If you'd like a shorthand for the get command, you put this in your .zshrc/.bashrc file

```
alias rum="rummage get"
```

## Usage

Before using rummage regularly, It's reccommended that you use

```
rummage populate
```

This will get the database up to speed with the third party packages you have already installed.
